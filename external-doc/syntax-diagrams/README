
                    The GnuCOBOL Grammar
                      for version 2.2

This document describes the syntax of COBOL as supported by GnuCOBOL. It is hoped
it will complement Gary Cutler’s 2013 GnuCOBOL Programmer’s Guide which (at the date
of creating this document) does not document recent features added to GnuCOBOL.

It is also formatted in LATEX, so that everything looks a bit prettier.

The syntax diagrams were transcribed from GnuCOBOL’s parsers. It thus replicates
some unusual syntax rules and misses some syntax rules implemented outside the parser.
For example, the obsolete identification division comment paragraphs are allowed in any
order and the syntax of a file-control entry does not distinguish between SEQUENTIAL,
INDEXED and RELATIVE organisations.

This is a draft and so has many flaws. Designed to document features the Programmer’s
Guide does not, it strangely lacks a list of these new features. Important syntax rules
which cannot be contained in syntax diagrams are missing. There are no definitions of
fundamental objects such as conditions and identifiers yet.
If people find this document useful, I will try to fix these shortcomings.

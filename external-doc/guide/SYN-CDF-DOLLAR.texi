 $ (Dollar) Directives - Active.

 These directives are active and have the same function as ones starting with >>:

 $DISPLAY ON|OFF
 $SET
 $IF
 $ELIF
 $ELSE-IF
 $END

 It is recommend to use the standard directives only instead of the MF directives
 (when possible) as these have a a higher chance for being portable.

 $ (Dollar) Directives - Not Active.
 These are NOT active and will produce a warning message:

 $DISPLAY VCS ...

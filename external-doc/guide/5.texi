@enumerate
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{WITH} is optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program.
@p @item This paragraph is not allowed in a nested subprogram --- nested programs will inherit the @syntax{SOURCE-COMPUTER} settings of their parent program.

@diagram{OBJECT-COMPUTER,ED-OBJECT-COMPUTER,ED-OBJECT-COMPUTER,ED-OBJECT-COMPUTER}@p This paragraph describes the computer upon which the program will execute.
@enumerate
@p @item The @term{computer-name}, if specified, must immediately follow the @syntax{OBJECT-COMPUTER} paragraph name.  The remaining clauses may be coded in any sequence.
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{CHARACTER}, @syntax{IS}, @syntax{PROGRAM} and @syntax{SEQUENCE} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The value specified for @term{computer-name}, if any, is irrelevant provided it is a valid COBOL word that does not match any GnuCOBOL reserved word.  The @term{computer-name} may include spaces.  This need not match the @term{computer-name} used with the @syntax{SOURCE-COMPUTER} paragraph, if any.
@p @item The @syntax{OBJECT-COMPUTER} paragraph is not allowed in a nested subprogram --- nested programs will inherit the @syntax{OBJECT-COMPUTER} settings of their parent program.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{COLLATING SEQUENCE} clause allows you to specify a customized character collating sequence to be used when alphanumeric values are compared to one another.  Data will still be stored in the character set native to the computer, but the logical sequence in which characters are ordered for comparison purposes can be altered from that defined by the computer's native character set.  The @term{alphabet-name-1} you specify needs to be defined in the @syntaxref{SPECIAL-NAMES} paragraph.
@p @item If no @syntax{COLLATING SEQUENCE} clause is specified, the collating sequence implied by the character set native to the computer (usually ASCII) will be used.
@p @item The optional @syntaxidx{CLASSIFICATION} clause may be used to specify a locale for the environment in which the program will be executing, for the purpose of influencing the upper-case and lower-case mappings of characters for the @syntaxref{UPPER-CASE} and @syntaxref{LOWER-CASE} intrinsic functions and the classification of characters for the @syntax{ALPHABETIC}, @syntax{ALPHABETIC-LOWER} and @syntax{ALPHABETIC-UPPER} class tests.  The definitions of these classes will be taken from the cultural convention specification (@syntax{LC_CTYPE}) from the specified locale.
@p The meanings of the four locale specifications are as follows:
@enumerate A
@p @item @term{locale-name-1} references a @syntaxrefalt{LOCALE,SPECIAL-NAMES} definition.
@p @item The keyword @syntax{LOCALE} refers to the current locale (in effect at the time the program is executed)
@p @item The keyword @syntax{USER-DEFAULT} references the default locale specified for the user currently executing this program.
@p @item The keyword @syntax{SYSTEM-DEFAULT} denotes the default locale specified for the computer upon which the program is executing.
@end enumerate
@item Absence of a @syntax{CLASSIFICATION} clause will cause character classification to occur according to the rules for the computer's native character set (ASCII, EBCDIC, @dots{}).

@center @clause{Alphabet-Name-Clause}, @clause{Class-Definition-Clause},
@center @clause{Switch-Definition-Clause} and @clause{Symbolic-Characters-Clause}
@center are discussed in detail in the next four sections.
@p The @syntax{SPECIAL-NAMES} paragraph provides a means for specifying various program and operating environment configuration options.
@enumerate
@p @item The various clauses that may be specified within the @syntax{SPECIAL-NAMES} paragraph may be coded in any order.
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{IS} is optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The @syntax{SPECIAL-NAMES} paragraph is not allowed in a nested subprogram --- nested programs will inherit the @syntax{SPECIAL-NAMES} settings of their parent program.
@p @item Only the final clause specified within this paragraph should be terminated with a period.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{CALL-CONVENTION} clause allows a decimal integer, representing a series of ON/OFF switch settings, to be associated with a mnemonic name which may then be coded on a @statementref{CALL}.  The switch settings defined by this mnemonic will then control how the linkage to a subroutine invoked by the @syntax{CALL} statement that references @term{mnemonic-name-1} will be handled.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{CONSOLE IS CRT} clause, if specified, will cause a @statement{DISPLAY} lacking an explicit @syntax{UPON} clause to be treated as a @statementref{DISPLAY screen-data-item}, and any @statement{ACCEPT} lacking a @syntax{FROM} clause to be treated as a @statementref{ACCEPT screen-data-item}.
@p @item If the @syntaxidx{CRT STATUS} clause is not specified, an implicit @syntaxidx{COB-CRT-STATUS} identifier (with a @syntax{PICTURE 9(4)}) will be allocated for the purpose of receiving screen @syntax{ACCEPT} statuses.  If @syntax{CRT STATUS} is specified, then @term{identifier-1} must be defined in the program as a @syntax{PICTURE 9(4)} field.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{CURRENCY SIGN} clause may be used to redefine the character to be used as a currency sign in a @syntaxref{PICTURE} clause.  The default currency sign is a dollar-sign ($).  You may specify any character @i{except} @syntax{0}-@syntax{9}, @syntax{A}-@syntax{Z}, @syntax{a}-@syntax{z}, @syntax{+}, @syntax{-}, @syntax{,}, @syntax{.}, @syntax{*}, @syntax{/}, @syntax{;}, @syntax{(}, @syntax{)}, @syntax{=}, @syntax{\\}, quote (") or space.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{CURSOR IS} clause allows you to specify a 4- or 6-character data item into which the cursor screen location at the time a screen @syntax{ACCEPT} is satisfied.  The value will be returned as @i{rrcc} or @i{rrrccc}, depending upon the length of the specified @term{identifier-2}, where @i{rr} and @i{rrr} represent the row number (starting at zero) and @i{cc} and @i{ccc} represent the column number (also starting at zero).  There is no default data item allocated for this data if the @syntax{CURSOR IS} clause is not specified, and it is the programmer's responsibility to define @term{identifier-2} if the clause is specified.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{DECIMAL POINT IS COMMA} clause reverses the definition of the "," and "." characters when they are used as @syntax{PICTURE} editing symbols and within numeric literals.  This can have unwanted side-effects - see @ref{Punctuation}.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{LOCALE} clause may be used to associate external OS-defined locale names (@term{literal-2}) with an internal name (@term{locale-name-1}) that may then be referenced within the program.  Locale names are defined by the Operating System and/or C compiler GnuCOBOL will be utilizing on your computer.
@p @item The following is the list of possible locale codes, for example, that would be available on a Windows computer running a GnuCOBOL version that was built utilizing the MinGW Unix-emulator and the GNU C compiler (gcc):

@item The @syntaxidx{NUMERIC SIGN TRAILING SEPARATE} specification causes all signed numeric @syntax{USAGE DISPLAY} data items to be created as if the @syntax{SIGN IS TRAILING SEPARATE CHARACTER} clause was included in their definitions.
@p @item  The @syntax{@term{device-name-1} IS @term{mnemonic-name-2}} clause allows you to specify an alternate name (@term{device-name-1}) for one of the built-in GnuCOBOL device name @term{mnemonic-name-2}.  The list of device names built-into GnuCOBOL, and the physical device associated with that name, are as follows:
@table @b
@p @item @syntaxidx{CONSOLE}
@p This is the (screen-mode) display of the PC or Unix system.
@p @item @syntaxidx{STDIN}
@itemx @syntaxidx{SYSIN}
@itemx @syntaxidx{SYSIPT}
@p These devices (they are all synonymous) represent standard system input (pipe 0).  On a PC or UNIX system, this is typically the keyboard.  The contents of a file may be delivered to a GnuCOBOL program for access via one of these device names by adding the sequence "0< filename" to the end of the programs execution command.
@p @item @syntaxidx{PRINTER}
@itemx @syntaxidx{STDOUT}
@itemx @syntaxidx{SYSLIST}
@itemx @syntaxidx{SYSLST}
@itemx @syntaxidx{SYSOUT}
@p These devices (they are all synonymous) represent standard system output (pipe 1).  On a PC or UNIX system, this is typically the display.  Output sent to one of these devices by a GnuCOBOL program can be sent to a file by adding the sequence "1> filename" to the end of the programs execution command.
@p @item @syntaxidx{STDERR}
@itemx @syntaxidx{SYSERR}
@p These devices (they are synonymous) represent standard system error output (pipe 2).  On a PC or UNIX system, this is typically the display.  Output sent to one of these devices by a GnuCOBOL program can be sent to a file by adding the sequence "2> filename" to the end of the programs execution command.
@end table
@item The @syntax{@term{feature-name-1} IS @term{mnemonic-name-3}} clause allow for mnemonic names to be assigned to up to the 13 printer channel (i.e. vertical page positioning) position feature names @syntax{Cnn} (nn=01-12) and @syntax{CSP}.  Once a channel position has been assigned a mnemonic name, statements of the form @syntax{WRITE @term{record-name} AFTER ADVANCING @term{mnemonic-name-3}} may be coded to write the specified print record at the channel position assigned to @term{mnemonic-name-3}.
@p Printers supporting channel positioning are generally mainframe-type line printers.  When writing to printers that do not support channel positioning, a formfeed will be issued to the printer.
@p The @syntax{CSP} positioning option stands for "No Spacing".  Testing on a MinGW build of GnuCOBOL shows that this too results in a formfeed being issued.

@diagram{SPECIAL-NAMES ALPHABET Literal-Clause,ED-SPECIAL-NAMES-L-Info,ED-SPECIAL-NAMES-L-TeX,None}@p The @syntaxidx{ALPHABET} clause provides a means for relating a name to a specified character code set or collating sequence, including those you define yourself using the @term{literal-1} option.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{IS} is optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{THRU} and @syntax{THROUGH} are interchangeable.
@p @item GnuCOBOL considers @syntaxidx{ASCII}, @syntaxidx{STANDARD-1} and @syntaxidx{STANDARD-2} to be interchangeable.
@p @item @syntaxidx{NATIVE} specifies the system default character set.
@p @item The following points apply to using the @term{literal-n} specifications to compose a custom character set:
@enumerate A
@p @item The @term{literal-n} values are either integers or alphanumeric quoted characters.  These represent a single character in the @syntax{NATIVE} character set, either by it's actual text value (alphanumeric quoted character) or by ordinal position in the @syntax{NATIVE} character set (integer),
@p @item The sequence in which characters are defined in this clause specifies the relative order those characters should have when comparisons are made using this alphabet.
@p @item Character positions in this list do not affect the actual binary storage values used for the characters --- binary values will still be those of the @syntax{NATIVE} character set.
@p @item You may specify any of the figurative constants @syntax{SPACE}, @syntax{SPACES}, @syntax{ZERO}, @syntax{ZEROS}, @syntax{ZEROES}, @syntax{QUOTE}, @syntax{QUOTES}, @syntax{HIGH-VALUE}, @syntax{HIGH-VALUES}, @syntax{LOW-VALUE} or @syntax{LOW-VALUES} for any of the @term{literal-1}, @term{literal-2} or @term{literal-3} specifications.

@p @item  Both @term{literal-1} and @term{literal-2} must be alphanumeric literals of length 1.
@p @item  The literal(s) specified on this clause define the possible characters that may be found in a data item's value in order to be considered part of the class.
@p @item For example, the following defines a class called "Hexadecimal", the definition of which specifies the only characters that may be present in an alphanumeric data item if that data item is to be part of the "Hexadecimal" class:
@example

CLASS Hexadecimal IS '0' THRU '9'

@newunit{5.1.3.3,Switch-Definition-Clause}
@diagram{SPECIAL-NAMES Switch-Definition-Clause,ED-SPECIAL-NAMES-SD,ED-SPECIAL-NAMES-SD,None}@p The switch-definition clause associates a condition-name with a run-time execution switch so that the status of that switch may be tested from within a program.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{IS} and @syntax{STATUS} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The valid @term{switch-name-1} names are @syntaxidx{SWITCH-n} (n=0-36).
@p @item If the program is compiled with the @switchidx{-fsyntax-extension}, the switch names @syntaxidx{SWn} (n=0-15) are also valid; they correspond to @syntax{SWITCH-0} through @syntax{SWITCH-15}, respectively as well as @syntax{SWITCH-16} through @syntax{SWITCH-36}, @syntax{SWITCH 0} through @syntax{SWITCH 26} and @syntax{SWITCH A} through @syntax{SWITCH Z}.
@p @item At execution time, each switch will be associated with a @envvarruntimeref{COB_SWITCH_n}, where "n" will have the value "0" through "15".  Any of these sixteen environment variables that have the value "ON" (regardless of upper- or lower-case value) will be considered to be set "on".  Any of these sixteen environment variables having no value at all or a value other than "ON" will be considered "OFF".
@p @item Each specified switch must have at least one of a @syntax{IS @term{mnemonic-name-1}}, @syntax{ON STATUS} or an @syntax{OFF STATUS} option defined for it, otherwise there will be no way to reference the switch from within a GnuCOBOL program.
@p @item The @syntax{IS @term{mnemonic-name-1}} syntax provides a means for setting the switch to either an ON or OFF value via the @statementref{SET}.

@p @item Each symbolic character name will be associated with the corresponding @term{integer-1}th character in the alphabet named in the @syntax{IN} clause.  The integer values are selecting characters from the alphabet by their ordinal position and not by their numeric value; thus, an integer of 15 will select the 15th character in the specified alphabet, regardless of the actual numeric value of the bit pattern that constitutes that character.
@p @item If no @term{alphabet-name-1} is specified, the systems native character set will be assumed.

@newsubsection{5.1.4,REPOSITORY}
@diagram{REPOSITORY,ED-REPOSITORY,ED-REPOSITORY,None}@p The REPOSITORY paragraph provides a way to control access to the various built-in intrinsic functions and any user defined functions that your program will be using.
@enumerate
@p @item The @syntax{REPOSITORY} paragraph is not allowed in a nested subprogram --- nested programs will inherit the @syntax{REPOSITORY} settings of their parent program.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{INTRINSIC} clause allows you to flag one or more (or @syntaxidx{ALL}) built-in intrinsic functions as being usable without the need to code the keyword @syntaxidx{FUNCTION} in front of the function names.
@p @item As an alternative to using the @syntaxidx{ALL INTRINSIC} clause, you may instead compile your GnuCOBOL programs using the @switchidx{-fintrinsics=ALL}.
@p @item The @term{function-prototype-name-1} option is required to specify the name of a user-defined function your program will be using.  Optionally, should you desire, you may specify an alias name by which you will reference that user-defined function.  Should you wish, you may also use the @syntax{AS} clause to provide an alias name for a built-in intrinsic function.
@p @item The following example enables all intrinsic functions to be specified without the use of the @syntax{FUNCTION} keyword, (2) names two user-defined functions named "MY-FUNCTION-1" and "MY-FUNCTION-2" that will be used by the program and (3) specifies the alias names "SIGMA" for the intrinsic function "STANDARD-DEVIATION" and "MF2" for "MY-FUNCTION-2".
@example

REPOSITORY.
    FUNCTION ALL INTRINSIC.
    FUNCTION MY-FUNCTION-1.
    FUNCTION MY-FUNCTION-2 AS "MF2".
    FUNCTION STANDARD-DEVIATION AS "SIGMA".
@end example
@end enumerate
@* @strong{A special note about user-defined functions} --- because you must name a user-defined function that your program will be using in the @syntax{REPOSITORY} paragraph, you may always reference that function from your program's procedure division without needing to use the @syntax{FUNCTION} keyword.

@newsection{5.2,INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION}
@diagram{INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION,ED-IO-SECTION,ED-IO-SECTION,None}@p The @syntax{INPUT-OUTPUT} section provides for the definition of any files the program will be accessing as well as control of the I/O buffering process against those files through the @syntax{FILE-CONTROL} and @syntax{I-O-CONTROL} paragraphs, respectively.
@enumerate
@p @item As the diagram shows, there are three types of statements that may occur in the two paragraphs of this section.  If none of the statements are coded in a particular paragraph, the paragraph itself may be omitted, otherwise it is required.
@p @item If neither paragraph is coded, the @syntax{INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.} header itself may be omitted, otherwise it is normally required.
@p @item If the compiler "config" file you are using has "relaxed-syntax-check" set to "yes", the @syntax{FILE-CONTROL} and @syntax{I-O-CONTROL} paragraphs may be specified without the @syntax{INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.} header having been coded.

@newsubsection{5.2.1,SELECT}
@diagram{SELECT Statement,ED-SELECT,ED-SELECT,ED-SELECT}
@p The @statement{SELECT} creates a definition of a file and links that COBOL definition to the external operating system environment.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{AREAS}, @syntax{IS}, @syntax{MODE}, @syntax{OTHER}, @syntax{SEQUENCE}, @syntax{TO}, @syntax{USING} and @syntax{WITH} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item After @term{file-name-1}, the various clauses may be coded in any sequence.
@p @item A period must follow the last coded clause.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{OPTIONAL} clause, to be used only for files that will be used to provide input data to the program, indicates the file may or may not actually be available at run-time.  Attempts to @syntax{OPEN} an @syntax{OPTIONAL} file when the file does not exist will receive a special non-fatal file status value (see status 05 in the list of file status values below) indicating the file is not available; a subsequent attempt to @syntax{READ} that file will return an @syntax{AT END} (end-of-file) condition.  Optionally, files may be designated as @syntax{NOT OPTIONAL}, if desired.  This is useful when specifying the compiler's @switchidx{-foptional-file}, which automatically makes all files @syntax{OPTIONAL} except for those explicitly declared as @syntax{NOT OPTIONAL}.
@p @item The @term{file-name-1} value that you specify will be the name by which you will reference the file within your program.  This name should be formed according to the rules for user-defined names (@pxref{User-Defined Words}).
@p @item The optional @syntax{ASSIGN} clause specifies how --- at runtime, when @term{file-name-1} is opened --- either a logical device (STDIN, STDOUT) or a file anywhere in one of the currently-mounted file systems will be associated with @term{file-name-1}, as follows:
@enumerate A
@p @item There are three components to the @syntax{ASSIGN} clause --- a @clause{Type} specification (@syntax{EXTERNAL}, @syntax{DYNAMIC} or neither), a @clause{Device} (the list of device choices) and a @clause{Locator} (shown as a choice between @term{identifier-1}, @term{word-1} and @term{literal-1}).
@p @item @syntax{ASSIGN TO DISC '@term{file-name-1}'} will be assumed if there is no @syntax{ASSIGN} clause on a @syntax{SELECT}.
@p @item If an @syntax{ASSIGN} clause is coded without a @clause{Device}, the device @syntax{DISC} will be assumed.
@p @item If a @clause{Locator} clause is coded, the COBOL file @term{file-name-1} will be attached to a data file within any file system that is mounted and available to the executing program at the time @term{file-name-1} is opened.  How that file is identified varies, depending upon the specified @clause{Locator}, as follows:
@enumerate a
@p @item If @term{literal-1} is coded, the value of the literal will serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file.
@p @item If @term{identifier-1} is coded, the value of the identifier will serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file.
@p @item If @term{word-1} (a syntactically valid word not duplicating that of a reserved or user-defined word) is coded, and a @clause{Type} of @syntax{EXTERNAL} is specified, @term{word-1} itself will serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file.  If, however, a @clause{Type} of @syntax{EXTERNAL} was @i{not} specified, the compiler will create a @syntax{PIC X(1024)} data item named @term{word-1} within the program; the contents of that data item at the time the program opens @term{file-name-1} will then serve as the File Location String that will identify the data file.
@p @item File Location Strings will be discussed shortly.
@end enumerate
@item If no @clause{Locator} is coded, @term{file-name-1} will be attached to a logical device or a file based upon the specified (or implied) @clause{Device}, as follows:
@enumerate a
@p @item @syntax{DISC} or @syntax{DISK} will assume an attachment to a file named @term{file-name-1} in whatever directory is current at the time the file is opened.
@p @item @syntax{DISPLAY} will assume an attachment to the @syntax{STDOUT} logical device; these files should only be used for output.
@p @item @syntax{KEYBOARD} will assume an attachment to the @syntax{STDIN} logical device; these files should only be used for input.
@p @item @syntax{PRINTER} will assume an attachment to the @syntax{LPT1} logical device/port; these files should only be used for output.
@p @item @syntax{RANDOM} or @syntax{TAPE} will behave exactly as @syntax{DISC} does.  These two additional @clause{Device}s are provided to facilitate the compilation of COBOL source from other COBOL implementations.
@end enumerate
@item The @syntax{LINE ADVANCING} device @i{requires} that a @clause{Locator} be specified; these files should only be used for output.  A COBOL Line Advancing file will allow carriage-control characters such as line-feeds and form-feeds to be written to the attached operating system file, via the @syntax{ADVANCING} clause of the @statementref{WRITE}.
@p @item File Location Strings are used (at runtime) to identify the path and filename to the data file that must be attached to @term{file-name-1} when that file is opened.
@p @item If the compiler "config" file you used to compile the program with had a "filename-mapping" value of "yes", the GnuCOBOL runtime system will first attempt to identify a currently-defined environment variable whose value will serve as the data file's path and filename, as follows:
@enumerate a
@p @item If the compiler "config" file (@pxref{Compiler Configuration Files}) you used to compile the program specified "mf" as the "assign-clause" value, then the File Locator String will be interpreted according to Microfocus COBOL rules --- namely, everything before the last "-" in the File Locator String will be ignored; the characters after the last "-" will be treated as the base of an environment variable name.  If there is no "-" character in the File Locator String then the entire File Locator String will serve as the base of an environment variable name.  This is the default behaviour for every config file except "ibm".
@p @item If, on the other hand, the compiler "config" file you used to compile the program specified "mf" as the "assign-clause" value, then the File Locator String will be interpreted according to according to IBM COBOL rules --- namely, the File Locator String is expected to be of the form "S-xxx" or "AS-xxx", in which case the "xxx" will be treated as the base of an environment variable name.  If there is no "-" character in the File Locator String then the entire File Locator String will serve as the base of an environment variable name.
@p @item Once an environment variable name base (let's refer to it as "bbbb") has been determined, the runtime system will look for the first one of the following environment variables that exists, in this sequence:
@p @format
DD_bbbb
dd_bbbb
bbbb
@end format
@* Windows systems are case-insensitive with regard to environment variables, so there is no difference between the first two when using a GnuCOBOL implementation built for either Windows/MinGW or native Windows.
@p If an environment variable was found, it's value will serve as the path and filename to the data file.
@end enumerate
@item If no environment variable was found, or the "config" file used to compile the program had a "filename-mapping" value of "no", then the File Locator String value will serve as the path and filename to the data file.
@p @item Paths and file names may be specified on an absolute (@syntax{C:\\Data\\datafile.dat}, @syntax{/Data/datafile.dat}, @dots{}) or relative-to-the-current-directory (@syntax{Data\\datafile.dat}, @syntax{Data/datafile.dat}, @dots{}) basis.
@p There may not even be a path (@syntax{datafile.dat}), in which case the file must be in the current directory.
@end enumerate
@item The @syntaxidx{FILE STATUS} or @syntaxidx{SORT STATUS} clause (they are both equivalent and only one or the other, if any, should be specified) is used to specify the name of a two-digit numeric data item into which an I/O status code will be saved after every I/O verb that is executed against the file.  This does not actually allocate the data item --- you must define the item yourself somewhere in the data division.
@p @anchoridx{File Status Codes}Possible status codes that can be returned to a @syntax{FILE STATUS} data item are as follows:

@item The @syntaxidx{SHARING} clause defines the conditions under which the program will be willing (or not) to allow other programs executing at the same time to access the file.  @xref{File Sharing}, for the details.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{LOCK} clause defines how concurrent access to the file will be managed on a record-by-record basis.  @xref{Record Locking}, for the details.
@p @item A @syntax{SELECT} statement without an @syntax{ORGANIZATION} explicitly coded will be handled as if the following ORGANIZATION clause had been specified:

For example, an indexed file containing product data might use the product identification code as a record key.

@p @item  The @syntaxidx{ALTERNATE RECORD KEY} clause, if used, defines an additional field within the record that provides an alternate means of directly accessing records or an additional field by which the file's contents may be processed sequentially.

These buffers can sometimes get quite large, and by having multiple files share the same buffer memory you may significantly cut down the amount of memory the program is using (thus making "room" for more procedural code or data).  If you do use this feature, take care to ensure that no more than one of the specified files are ever OPEN simultaneously.

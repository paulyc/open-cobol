@comment *********************************************************************
@newsection{5.1,Data Definition Principles}GNU COBOL data items, like those of other COBOL implementations, are described in a hierarchical manner.  This accommodates the fact that data items frequently need to be able to be broken up into subordinate items.  Take for example, the following logical layout of a portion of a data item named @syntax{Employee}:
@ifinfo
@verbatim
                           Employee
                               |                     Additional
              :----------------:----------------:--> Data Items ...
              |                                 |
        Employee-name                    Employment-Dates
              |                                 |
    :---------:-------------:           :-------:-------:
    |         |             |           |               |
Last-Name First-Name Middle-Initial From-Date        To-Date
                                        |               |
                                   :----:----:     :----:----:
                                   |    |    |     |    |    |
                                 Year Month Day  Year Month Day
@end verbatim
@end ifinfo
@iftex
@sp 1
@center @image{hierarchy,6in,}
@end iftex
@* The @syntax{Employee} data item consists of two subordinate data items --- an @syntax{Employee-Name} and an @syntax{Employment-Dates} data item (presumably there would be a lot of others too, but we don't care about them right now).  As the diagram shows, each of those data items are, in turn, broken down into subordinate data items.  This hierarchy of data items can get rather @syntax{deep}, and GNU COBOL, like other COBOL implementations, can handle up to 49 levels of such hierarchical structures.
@p As was presented earlier (@pxref{Structured Data}), a data item that is broken down into other data items is referred to as a group item, while one that isn't broken down is called an elementary item.
@p COBOL uses the concept of a "level number" to indicate the level at which a data item occurs in a data structure such as the example shown above.  When these data items are defined, they are all defined together with a number in the range 1-49 specified in front of their names.  Over the years, a convention has come to exist among COBOL programmers that level numbers are always coded as two-digit numbers --- they don't @i{have} to be specified as two-digit numbers, but every example you see in this document will take that approach!
@p The data item at the top, also referred to as a "record", always has a level number of 01.  After that, you may assign level numbers as you wish (01--02--03--04@dots{}, 01--05--10--15@dots{}, etc.), as long as you follow these simple rules:
@enumerate
@p @item Every data item at the same @syntax{level} of a hierarchy diagram such as the one you see here (if you were to make one, which you rarely --- if ever --- will, once you get used to this concept) must have the same level number.
@p @item Every new level uses a level number that is strictly greater than the one used in the parent (next higher) level.
@p @item When describing data hierarchies, you may never use a level number greater than 49 (except for 66, 77, 78 and 88 which have very special meanings --- see @pxref{Special Data Items}).
@end enumerate
@* So, the definition of these data items in a GNU COBOL program would go something like this:
@verbatim
    01  Employee
        05 Employee-Name
           10 Last-Name
           10 First-Name
           10 Middle-Initial
        05 Employment-Dates
           10 From-Date
              15 Year
              15 Month
              15 Day
           10 To-Date
              15 Year
              15 Month
              15 Day
@end verbatim
@* The indentation is purely at the discretion of the programmer to make things easier for humans to read (the compiler couldn't care less).  Historically, COBOL implementations that required Fixed Format Mode source programs required that the @syntax{01} level number begin in Area A and that everything else begins in Area B.  GNU COBOL only requires that all data definition syntax occur in columns 8-72.  In Free Format Mode, of course, there aren't even those limitations.
@p Did you notice that there are two each of @syntax{Year}, @syntax{Month} and @syntax{Day} data names defined?  Thet's perfectly legal, provided that each can be uniquely @syntax{qualified} so as to be distinct from the other.  Take for example the @syntax{Year} items.  One is defined as part of the @syntax{From-Date} data item while the other is defined as part of the "To-Date" data item.  In COBOL, we would actually code references to these two data items as either @syntax{Year OF From-Date} and @syntax{Year OF To-Date} or @syntax{Year IN From-Date} and @syntax{Year IN To-Date} (COBOL allows either @syntax{IN} or @syntax{OF} to be used).  Since these references would clarify any confusion to us as to which @syntax{Year} might be referenced, the GNU COBOL compiler won't be confused either.
@p The coding example shown above is incomplete --- it only describes the data item names and their hierarchical relationships to one other.  In addition, any valid data item definitions will also need to describe what type of data is to be contained in a data item (Numeric? Alphanumeric? Alphabetic?), how much data can be held in the data item and a multitude of other characteristics.
@p When group items are being defined, subordinate items may be assigned a @syntax{name} of @syntaxidx{FILLER}.  There may be any number of @syntax{FILLER} items defined within a group item.  A data item named @syntax{FILLER} cannot be referenced directly; these items are generally used to specify an unused portion of the total storage allocated to a group item.  Note that it is possible that the name of the group item itself might be specified as @syntax{FILLER} if there is no need to ever refer directly to the group structure itself.

@p @item The reserved words @syntax{ARE}, @syntax{AT}, @syntax{CHARACTERS} (@syntax{RECORD} clause only), @syntax{CONTAINS}, @syntax{FROM}, @syntax{IN}, @syntax{IS}, @syntax{ON} and @syntax{WITH} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The terms @syntax{RECORD IS} and @syntax{RECORDS ARE} are interchangeable.
@p @item The terms @syntax{REPORT IS} and @syntax{REPORTS ARE} are interchangeable.
@p @item Only files intended for use as work files for either the @syntaxref{SORT} or @syntaxref{MERGE} statements should be coded with an SD --- all others should be defined with a FD.
@p @item The sequence in which files are defined via @syntax{FD} or @syntax{SD}, as compared to the sequence in which their @syntax{SELECT} statements were coded, is irrelevant.
@p @item  The name specified as @term{file-name-1} must exactly match the name specified on the file's @syntax{SELECT} statement.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{CODE-SET} clause allows a custom alphabet, defined in the @syntaxref{SPECIAL-NAMES} paragraph, to be associated with a file. This clause is valid only when used with sequential or line sequential files.
@p @item The @syntax{LINAGE} clause may only be specified in the @syntax{FD} of a sequential or line sequential file.  If used with a sequential file, the organization of that file will be implicitly changed to line sequential.   The various components of the @syntax{LINAGE} clause define the layout of printed pages as follows:
@itemize @bullet
@p @item @syntaxidx{LINES AT TOP} --- the number of unused (i.e. left blank) lines at the top of every page.  The default if this if not specified is zero.
@p @item @syntaxidx{LINES AT BOTTOM} --- the number of unused (i.e. left blank) lines at the bottom of every page.  The default if this if not specified is zero.
@p @item @syntaxidx{LINAGE IS n LINES} --- the total number of used/usable lines on the page.
@p @item The sum of the previous three specifications should be the total number of possible lines available on one printed page.
@p @item @syntaxidx{FOOTING AT} --- the line number beyond which nothing may be printed except for any footing that is to appear on every page.  The default for this if not specified is zero, meaning there will be no footings.  This value cannot be larger than the @syntax{LINAGE IS n LINES} value.
@end itemize
@item This page structure --- once defined --- can be automatically enforced by the @statementref{WRITE}.
@p @item Specifying a @syntax{LINAGE} clause in an @syntax{FD} will cause the @register{LINAGE-COUNTER} to be created for the file.  This automatically-created data item will always contain the current relative line number on the page being prepared which will serve as the starting point for a @statement{WRITE}.
@p @item  The @syntaxidx{RECORD CONTAINS} and @syntaxidx{RECORD IS VARYING} clauses are ignored (with a warning message issued) when used with line sequential files.  With other file organizations, these mutually-exclusive clauses define the length of data records within the file.  The data item specified as @term{identifier-6} must be defined within one of the record descriptions of @term{file-name-1}.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{REPORT IS} clause announces to the compiler that the file will be dedicated to the Report Writer Control System (RWCS); the clause names one or more reports, each to be described in the report section.  The following special rules apply when the @syntax{REPORT} clause is used:
@enumerate A
@p @item The clause may only be specified in the @syntax{FD} of a sequential or line sequential file.  If used with a sequential file, the organization of that file will be implicitly changed to line sequential.
@p @item The @syntax{FD} cannot be followed by record descriptions --- detailed descriptions of data to be printed to the file will be defined in the @syntaxref{REPORT SECTION}.
@p @item If a @syntax{LINAGE} clause is also specified, Values specified for @syntax{LINAGE IS} and @syntax{FOOTING AT} will be ignored.  The values of @syntax{LINES AT BOTTOM} and @syntax{LINES AT TOP}, if any, will be honored.
@end enumerate
@item The following special rules apply only to sort/merge work files:
@enumerate A
@p @item Sort/merge work files should be assigned to @syntax{DISK} (or @syntax{DISC}) on their @syntax{SELECT} statements.
@p @item Sorts and merges will be performed in memory, if the amount of data being sorted allows.
@p @item Should actual disk work files be necessary due to the amount of data being sorted or merged, they will be automatically allocated to disk in a folder defined by:
@itemize @bullet
@p @item The @envvarruntimeref{TMPDIR}
@p @item The @envvarruntime{TMP}
@p @item The @envvarruntime{TEMP}
@end itemize
@* (in that order)
@p @item These disk files will be automatically purged upon @syntax{SORT} or @syntax{MERGE} termination.  They will also be purged if the program terminates abnormally before the @syntax{SORT} or @syntax{MERGE} finishes.  Should you ever need to know, temporary sort/merge work files will be named "cob*.tmp".
@p @item If you specify a specific filename in the sort/merge work file's @syntax{SELECT}, it will be ignored.

@item Not specifying an @term{identifier-1} or @syntax{FILLER} immediately after the level number has the same effect as if @syntax{FILLER} were specified.  A data item named @syntax{FILLER} cannot be referenced directly; these items are generally used to specify an unused portion of the total storage allocated to a group item or to describe a group item whose contents which will only be referenced using the names of those items that belong to it.  In the linkage section, 01-level data items cannot be named @syntax{FILLER}.
@p @item No storage is allocated for data defined in the linkage section; the data descriptions there are merely defining storage areas that will be passed to the subprogram by a calling program.  Therefore, any discussion of the default initialization of such data is irrelevant.  It @i{is} possible, however, to manually allocate linkage section data items that aren't subprogram arguments via the @statementref{ALLOCATE} statement.  In such cases, initialization will take place as per the documentation of that statement.

@diagram{Report-Description (RD),DD-RS-RD,DD-RS-RD,DD-RS-RD}@p This section describes the layout of printed reports as well as many of the functional aspects of the generation of reports that will be produced via the Report Writer Control System.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{ARE} and @syntax{IS} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The phrases @syntax{CONTROL IS} and @syntax{CONTROLS ARE} are interchangeable, as are the @syntax{PAGE LIMIT} and @syntax{PAGE LIMITS} phrases.
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{LINES} may be abbreviated as @syntax{LINE}.
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{COLUMNS} may be abbreviated as @syntax{COLS}.
@p @item Each report referenced on a @syntax{REPORT IS} clause (@pxref{File/Sort-Description}) must be described with a report description (@syntax{RD}).
@p @item @xref{GLOBAL}, for information on the @syntax{GLOBAL} option.
@p @item Please see @ref{Report Writer Features}, if you have not read it already.  This will familiarize you with the Report Writer terminology that will follow.
@p @item The following rules pertain to the @syntaxidx{PAGE LIMITS} clause:
@enumerate A
@p @item If no @syntax{PAGE LIMITS} clause is specified, the entire report will be generated as if it consists of a single arbitrarily long page.
@p @item All literals (@term{literal-2} through @term{literal-8}) must be numeric with non-zero positive integer values.
@p @item All identifiers (@term{identifier-2} through @term{identifier-8}) must be numeric, unedited with non-zero positive integer values.
@p @item Any value specified for @term{literal-2}|@term{identifier-2} will define the total number of available lines on any report page, not counting any unused margins at the top and/or bottom of the page (defined by the @syntax{LINES AT TOP} and @syntax{LINES AT BOTTOM} values specified on the @syntax{LINAGE} clause of the @syntax{FD} this @syntax{RD} is linked to --- @pxref{File/Sort-Description}).
@p @item Any value specified for @term{literal-3}|@term{identifier-3} will be ignored.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{HEADING} clause defines the first line number at which a report heading or page heading may be presented.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{FIRST DETAIL} clause defines the first line at which a detail group may be presented.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{LAST CONTROL} HEADING clause defines the last line at which any line of a control heading may be presented.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{LAST DETAIL} clause defines the last line at which any line of a detail group may be presented.
@p @item The @syntaxidx{FOOTING} clause defines the last line at which any line of a control footing group may be presented.
@p @item The following rules establish default values for the various @syntax{PAGE LIMIT} clauses, assuming there is one:
@itemize @bullet
@p @item @syntax{HEADING} --- the default is one (1)
@p @item @syntax{FIRST DETAIL} --- the HEADING value is used
@p @item @syntax{LAST CONTROL HEADING} --- the value from @syntax{LAST DETAIL} or, if that is absent, the value from @syntax{FOOTING} or, if that too is absent, the value from @syntax{PAGE LIMIT}
@p @item @syntax{LAST DETAIL} --- the value from @syntax{FOOTING} or, if that is absent, the value from @syntax{PAGE LIMIT}
@p @item @syntax{FOOTING} --- the value from @syntax{LAST DETAIL} or, if that is absent, the value from @syntax{PAGE LIMIT}
@end itemize
@item For the values specified on a @syntax{PAGE LIMIT} clause to be valid, all of the following must be true:
@itemize @bullet
@p @item @syntax{HEADING} not > @syntax{FIRST DETAIL}
@p @item @syntax{FIRST DETAIL} not > @syntax{LAST CONTROL HEADING}
@p @item @syntax{LAST CONTROL HEADING} not > @syntax{LAST DETAIL}
@p @item @syntax{LAST DETAIL} not > @syntax{FOOTING}
@end itemize
@end enumerate
@item The following rules pertain to the @syntaxidx{CONTROL} clause:
@enumerate A
@p @item If there is no @syntax{CONTROL} clause, the report will contain no control breaks; this implies that there can be no @syntax{CONTROL HEADING} or @syntax{CONTROL FOOTING} report groups defined for this @syntax{RD}.
@p @item Include the reserved word @syntaxidx{FINAL} if you want to include a special control heading before the first detail line is generated (@syntax{CONTROL HEADING FINAL}) or after the last detail line is generated (@syntax{CONTROL FOOTING FINAL}).
@p @item If you specify @syntax{FINAL}, it must be the first control break named in the @syntax{RD}.
@p @item Any @term{identifier-9} specifications included on the @syntax{CONTROL} clause are referencing data names defined in any data division section except for the report section.
@p @item There must be a @syntax{CONTROL HEADING} and/or @syntax{CONTROL FOOTING} report group defined in the report section for each @term{identifier-9}.
@p @item At execution time:
@itemize @bullet
@p @item Each time a @statementref{GENERATE} is executed against a detail report group defined for this @syntax{RD}, the RWCS will check the contents of each @term{identifier-2} data item; whenever an @term{identifier-9}'s value has changed since the previous GENERATE, a control break condition will be in effect for that @term{identifier-2}.
@p @item Once the list of control breaks has been determined, the @syntax{CONTROL FOOTING} for each @term{identifier-2} having a control break (if any such report group is defined) will be presented.
@p @item Next, the @syntax{CONTROL HEADING} for each @term{identifier-2} having a control break (if any such report group is defined) will be presented.
@p @item The @syntax{CONTROL FOOTING} and @syntax{CONTROL HEADING} report groups will be presented in the sequence in which they are listed on the @syntax{CONTROL} clause.
@p @item Only after this processing has occurred will the detail report group specified on the @syntax{GENERATE} be presented.
@end itemize
@end enumerate
@item Each @syntax{RD} will have the following allocated for it:
@enumerate A
@p @item The @registerref{PAGE-COUNTER}, which will contain the current report page number.
@itemize @bullet
@p @item This register will be set to a value of 1 when an @statementref{INITIATE} is executed for the report and will be incremented by 1 each time the RWCS starts a new page of the report.
@p @item References to @syntax{PAGE-COUNTER} within the report section will be implicitly qualified with the name of the report to which the report group referencing the register belongs.
@p @item References to @syntax{PAGE-COUNTER} in the procedure division must be qualified with the appropriate report name if there are multiple @syntax{RD}s defined.
@end itemize
@item The @register{LINE-COUNTER}, which will contain the current line number on the current page.

@p The 01-level constant is one of four types of compilation-time constants that can be declared within a program.  The other three types are @directiveref{>>DEFINE} constants, @directiveref{>>SET} constants and 78-level constants (@pxref{78-Level Data Items}).
@enumerate

@p @item This particular type of constant declaration provides the ability to determine the length of a data item or the storage size associated with a particular numeric @syntaxref{USAGE} type --- something not possible with the other types of constants.
@p @item  Constants defined in this way become undefined once an @syntax{END PROGRAM} or @syntax{END FUNCTION} is encountered in the input source.
@p @item  Data descriptions of this form do not actually allocate any storage --- they merely define a name (@term{constant-name-1}) that may be used anywhere a numeric literal (@syntaxidx{BYTE-LENGTH} or @syntaxidx{LENGTH} options) or a literal of the same type as @term{literal-1} may be used.
@p @item  The @term{constant-name-1} name may not be referenced on a CDF directive.
@p @item  Care must be taken that @term{constant-name-1} does not duplicate any other data item name that has been defined in the program as references to that data item name will refer to the constant and not the data item.  The GNU COBOL compiler will not issue a warning about this condition.
@p @item  The value specified for @term{usage-name} may be any @syntax{USAGE} that does not use a @syntaxref{PICTURE} clause.

@newsubsection{5.8.5,88-Level Data Items}@idx{Condition Names}
@diagram{88-Level-Data-Item,DD-88-Data-Item,DD-88-Data-Item,None}
@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{FILE}, @strong{WORKING-STORAGE}, @strong{LOCAL-STORAGE}, @strong{LINKAGE}, @strong{REPORT}, @strong{SCREEN}
@p Condition names are Boolean (i.e. TRUE / FALSE) data items that receive their TRUE and FALSE values based upon the values of the non 88-level data item whose definition they immediately follow.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{ARE}, @syntax{IS}, @syntax{SET} and @syntax{TO} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{THRU} and @syntax{THROUGH} are interchangeable.
@p @item Condition names are always defined subordinate to another (non 88-level) data item.  That data item must be an elementary item.  Whenever the parent data item assumes one of the values specified on the 88-level item's @syntaxref{VALUE} clause, @term{condition-name-1} will take on the value of TRUE.
@p @item Condition names do not occupy any storage.
@p @item The optional @syntax{THROUGH} clause allows a range of possible TRUE values to be specified.
@p @item Whenever the parent data item assumes any value @i{except} one of the values specified on @term{condition-name-1}'s @syntax{VALUE} clause, @term{condition-name-1} will take on the value of FALSE.
@p @item Executing the statement @syntax{SET @term{condition-name-1} TO TRUE} will cause @term{condition-name-1}'s parent data item to take on the first value specified on @term{condition-name-1}'s @syntax{VALUE} clause.
@p @item Executing the statement @syntax{SET @term{condition-name-1} TO FALSE} will cause @term{condition-name-1}'s parent data item to take on the value specified on @term{condition-name-1}'s @syntax{FALSE} clause.  If @term{condition-name-1} does not have a @syntax{FALSE} clause, the @syntaxref{SET} statement will generate an error message at compilation time.

@diagram{COLUMN (REPORT SECTION) Clause,DD-COLUMN-1,DD-COLUMN-1,None}
@diagram{COLUMN (SCREEN SECTION) Clause,DD-COLUMN-2,DD-COLUMN-2,None}
@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{REPORT}, @strong{SCREEN}
@p The @syntax{COLUMN} clause provides the means of stating in which column a field should be presented on the console window (screen section) or a report (report section).
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{ARE}, @syntax{IS}, @syntax{NUMBER} and @syntax{NUMBERS} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{COLUMN} may be abbreviated as @syntax{COL}.
@p @item The line location of a report section or screen section field will be determined by the @syntaxref{LINE} clause.
@p @item The value of @term{integer-1} must be 1 or greater.
@p @item If @term{identifier-1} is used to specify either an absolute or relative column position, @term{identifier-1} must be defined as a numeric item of any @syntaxref{USAGE} other than @syntax{COMPUTATIONAL-1} or @syntax{COMPUTATIONAL-2}, without editing symbols.  The value of @term{identifier-1} at the time the screen data item is presented must be 1 or greater.  Note that a @syntax{COMPUTATIONAL-1} or @syntax{COMPUTATIONAL-2} identifier will be accepted by the compiler, but will produce unpredictable results at run-time.
@p @item The column coordinate of a field may be stated on an absolute basis (i.e. @syntax{COLUMN 5}) or on a relative basis based upon the end of the previously-presented field (i.e. @syntax{COLUMN PLUS 1}).
@p @item The symbol @syntax{+} may be used in lieue of the word @syntax{PLUS}, if desired; if symbol @syntax{+} is used, however, there must be at least one space separating it from @term{integer-1}.  Failure to include this space will cause the symbol @syntax{+} sign to be simply treated as part of @term{integer-1} and will treat the @syntax{COLUMN} clause as an absolute column specification rather than a relative one.
@p @item Using relative column positioning (@syntax{COLUMN PLUS}) has slightly different behavior depending upon the section in which the clause is used, as follows:
@enumerate A
@p @item When used on a report section data item, @syntax{COLUMN PLUS} will position the start of the new field's value such that there are @term{integer-1} blank columns between the end of the previous field and the beginning of this field.
@p If a report data item's description includes the @syntaxref{SOURCE}, @syntaxref{SUM} or @syntaxref{VALUE} clause but has no @syntax{COLUMN} clause, @syntax{COLUMN PLUS 1} will be assumed.
@p @item When used on a screen section data item, @syntax{COLUMN PLUS} will position the new field so that it begins exactly @term{integer-1} or @term{identifier-1} characters past the @i{last} character of the previous field.  Thus, @syntax{COLUMN PLUS 1} will  leave no blank positions between the end of the previous field and the start of this one.
@p If a screen data item's description includes the @syntaxref{FROM}, @syntaxref{TO}, @syntaxref{USING} or @syntaxref{VALUE} clause but has no @syntax{COLUMN} clause, the new screen field will begin at the column coordinate of the last character of the previous field.

@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:

@p This clause marks a data item, 01-level constant, @syntax{FD} (@pxref{File/Sort-Description}), @syntax{SD} (@pxref{File/Sort-Description}) or an @syntax{RD} (@pxref{REPORT SECTION}) as being sharable with any nested subprograms.
@enumerate
@p @item By specifying the @syntax{GLOBAL} clause on the description of a file or a report, that description is capable of being shared between a program and any nested subprograms within it, provided the @syntax{FD}, @syntax{SD} or @syntax{RD} is coded (with a @syntax{GLOBAL} clause) in each nested subprogram requiring it.  This sharing allows the file to be opened, read and/or written and closed or the report to be initiated or terminated in those programs.  Separately compiled programs may not share a @syntax{GLOBAL} file description, but they may share an @syntaxref{EXTERNAL} file description.  This sharing applies to the record descriptions subordinate to the file description and the report groups subordinate to the @syntax{RD} also.

@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{FILE}, @strong{WORKING-STORAGE}, @strong{LOCAL-STORAGE}, @strong{LINKAGE}, @strong{REPORT}, @strong{SCREEN}
@p The @syntax{OCCURS} clause is used to create a data structure called a table, where entries in that structure repeat multiple times.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{BY} (INDEXED), @syntax{IS}, @syntax{KEY}, @syntax{ON} and @syntax{TIMES} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The value of @term{integer-2} specifies how many entries will be allocated in the table.
@p @item The following is an example of how a table might be defined:
@p @example
05 QUARTERLY-REVENUE OCCURS 4 TIMES PIC 9(7)V99.
@end example
@* This will allocate the following:
@p @example
QUARTERLY-REVENUE(1)
QUARTERLY-REVENUE(2)
QUARTERLY-REVENUE(3)
QUARTERLY-REVENUE(4)
@end example
@* Each occurrence is referenced using the subscript syntax (a numeric literal, arithmetic expression or numeric identifier enclosed within parenthesis) shown above.
@p @item The @syntax{OCCURS} clause may be used at the group level too, in which case the entire group structure repeats, as follows:
@p @example
05 GRP OCCURS 3 TIMES.
    10 A     PIC X(1).
    10 B     PIC X(1).
    10 C     PIC X(1).
@end example
@* This would allow references to any of the following:
@p @example
GRP(1) - includes A(1), B(1) and C(1)
GRP(2) - includes A(2), B(2) and C(2)
GRP(3) - includes A(3), B(3) and C(3)
@end example
@* or each A,B,C item could be referenced as follows:
@p @example
A(1) - Character #1 of GRP(1)
B(1) - Character #2 of GRP(1)
C(1) - Character #3 of GRP(1)
A(2) - Character #1 of GRP(2)
B(2) - Character #2 of GRP(2)
C(2) - Character #3 of GRP(2)
A(3) - Character #1 of GRP(3)
B(3) - Character #2 of GRP(3)
C(3) - Character #3 of GRP(3)
@end example
@item The optional @syntaxidx{DEPENDING ON} clause can be added to an @syntax{OCCURS} to create a variable-length table.  In such cases, the value of @term{integer-1} specifies what the minimum number of entries in the table will be while @term{integer-2} specifies the maximum.  Such tables will be allocated out to the maximum size specified as @term{integer-2}.  At execution time the value of @term{identifier-1} will determine how many of the table elements are accessible.
@p @item See the documentation of the @syntaxref{SEARCH}, @syntaxref{SEARCH ALL} and @syntaxref{SORT} statements for explanations of the @syntaxidx{KEY} and @syntaxidx{INDEXED BY} clauses.
@p @item The @syntax{OCCURS} clause cannot be specified in a data description entry that has a level number of 01, 66, 77, or 88, although it is valid in data items described @i{subordinate} to an 01-level data item.
@p @item The following points apply to an @syntax{OCCURS} used in the report section:
@enumerate A
@p @item The optional @syntaxidx{STEP} clause defines an incrementation value that will be added to any absolute @syntaxref{LINE} or @syntaxref{COLUMN} number specifications that may be part of or subordinate to this data item's definition.
@p @item The optional @syntaxidx{VARYING} clause defines an identifier that may be used as a subscript for the multiple occurrences of this or any subordinate data item should the @syntaxref{SOURCE} or @syntaxref{SUM} clause(s) on this or subordinate data items reference entries within the table.  The @term{identifier-2} data item is dynamically created as needed and cannot be referenced outside the scope of the report data item definition.
@p @item The following two examples illustrate two different ways a report could include four quarters worth of sales figures in it's detail lines --- one doing things 'the hard way' and one using the advanced @syntax{OCCURS} capabilities of @syntax{STEP} and @syntax{VARYING}.  Both assume the definition of the following table exists in working-storage:
@p @center @t{05 SALES OCCURS 4 TIMES PIC 9(7)V99.}
@p First, the "Hard Way":
@p @example
10 COL 7  PIC $(7)9.99 SOURCE SALES(1).
10 COL 17 PIC $(7)9.99 SOURCE SALES(2).
10 COL 27 PIC $(7)9.99 SOURCE SALES(3).
10 COL 37 PIC $(7)9.99 SOURCE SALES(4).
@end example
@* And then using @syntax{STEP} and @syntax{VARYING}:
@p @example
10 COL 7  OCCURS 4 TIMES STEP 10 VARYING QTR FROM 1 BY 1
          PIC $(7)9.99 SOURCE SALES(QTR).

@newsubsection{5.9.33,PICTURE}
@diagram{PICTURE Clause,DD-PICTURE,DD-PICTURE,None}
@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{FILE}, @strong{WORKING-STORAGE}, @strong{LOCAL-STORAGE}, @strong{LINKAGE}, @strong{REPORT}, @strong{SCREEN}
@p The picture clause defines the class (numeric, alphabetic or alphanumeric), size and format of the data that may be contained by the data item being defined.  Sometimes this role is assisted by the @syntaxref{USAGE} clause, and in a few instances will be assumed entirely by that clause.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{IS} is optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of this word has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The reserved word @syntax{PICTURE} may be abbreviated as @syntax{PIC}.  Most programmers prefer to use the latter.
@p @item A picture clause may only be specified on an elementary item.
@p @item A @term{picture-string} is a sequence of the special symbols @syntax{$}, @syntax{*}, @syntax{+}, @syntax{,}, @syntax{-}, @syntax{.}, @syntax{/}, @syntax{0} (zero), @syntax{9}, @syntax{A}, @syntax{B}, @syntax{CR}, @syntax{DB}, @syntax{S}, @syntax{V}, @syntax{X} and @syntax{Z}.
@p @item In general, each picture symbol represents either a single character in storage or a single decimal digit.  There are a few exceptions, and they will be discussed as needed.
@p @item When a @term{picture-string} contains a repeated sequence of symbols --- @syntax{PIC 9999/99/99} --- for example, the repetition can be specified using a parenthetic repeat count, as in @syntax{PIC 9(4)/9(2)/9(2)}.  Using repeat counts is optional and their use (or not) is entirely at the discretion of the programmer.  Many programmers use repetition for small sequences (@syntax{PIC XXX}) and repeat counts for larger ones (@syntax{PIC 9(9)}.
@p @item This first set of picture symbols defines the basic data type of a data item.  Each symbol represents a single character's worth of storage.
@table @syntax
@p @item A
Defines storage reserved for a single alphabetic character (@syntax{A}-@syntax{Z}, @syntax{a}-@syntax{z}).
@p @item N
Defines storage reserved for a single character in the computer's @define{National Characterset}.  Support for national charactersets in GNU COBOL is currently only partially implemented, and the compile- and run-time effect of using the @syntax{N} picture symbol is the same as if @syntax{X(2)} had been coded, with the additional effect that such a field will qualify as a @syntax{NATIONAL} or @syntax{NATIONAL-EDITED} field on an @syntaxref{INITIALIZE} statement.
@p @item X
Defines storage reserved for a single alphanumeric character (any character).
@p @item 9
Defines storage reserved for a single numeric digit character (@syntax{0}-@syntax{9}).
@end table
@* Typically, only one kind of each of those symbols is used in the same picture clause, but that isn't a requirement.  Data items that, of the three symbols above, use nothing but @syntax{A} picture symbols are known as @define{Alphabetic Data Items} while those that use @syntax{9} picture symbols without any @syntax{A} or @syntax{X} symbols (or those that have a @syntax{USAGE} without a @syntax{PICTURE}) are known as @define{Numeric Data Items}.  All other data items are referred to as @define{Alphanumeric Data Items}.
@p If you need to allocate space for a data item whose format is two letters followed by five digits followed by three letters, you could use the @term{picture-string} @syntax{AA99999AAA}, @syntax{A(2)9(5)A(3)} @syntax{XXXXXXXXXX} or @syntax{X(10)}.  There is absolutely no functional difference whatsoever between the four --- none of them provide any functionality the others do not.  The first two probably make for better @i{documentation} of the expected field contents, but they don't provide any run-time enforcement capabilities.
@p As far as enforcement goes, however, both alphabetic and numeric picture strings do provide for both compile-time and run-time enforcement capabilities.  In the case of compilation enforcement, the compiler can issue warning messages if you attempt to specify a non-numeric value for a numeric data item or if you attempt to @syntaxref{MOVE} a non-numeric data item to one that is numeric.  Similar capabilities exist for alphabetic data items.  At run-time, you may use a special class test (@pxref{Class Conditions}) to determine if the contents of a data item are entirely numeric or entirely alphabetic.
@p @item The following picture symbols may be used with numeric data items.
@table @syntax
@p @item P
Defines an implied digit position that will be considered to be a zero when the data item is referenced at run-time.  This symbol is used to allow data items that will contain very large values to be allocated using less storage by assuming a certain number of trailing zeros (one per @syntax{P}) to exist at the end of values.
@p The @syntax{P} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p The @syntax{P} symbol may only be used at the beginning or end of a picture clause.
@p @syntax{P} is a repeatable symbol.
@p All computations and @syntaxref{MOVE} operations involving such a data item will behave as if the zeros were actually there.
@p For example, let's say you need to allocate a data item that contains however many millions of dollars of revenue your company has in gross revenues this year:
@p @t{01  Gross-Revenue    PIC 9(9).}
@p In which case 9 characters of storage will be reserved.  The values 000000000 thru 999999999 will represent the gross-revenues.   But, if only the millions are tracked (meaning the last six digits are always going to be 0), you could define the field as:
@p @t{01  Gross-Revenue  PIC 9(3)P(6).}
@p Whenever Gross-Revenue is referenced in calculations, or whenever its value is moved to another data item, the value of Gross-Revenue will be treated as if it is nnn000000, where 'nnn' is the actual value in storage.
@p If you wanted to store the value 128 million into that field, you would do so as if the @syntax{P}s were @syntax{9}s:
@p @t{MOVE 128000000 TO Gross-Revenue}
@p A @syntaxref{DISPLAY} of a data item containing @syntax{P} symbols is a little strange.  The value displayed will be what is actually in storage, but the total size of the displayed value will be as if the @syntax{P} symbols had been @syntax{9}s.  Thus, after the above statement established a value for Gross-Revenue, a @syntax{DISPLAY Gross-Revenue} would produce output of '@t{000000128}'.
@p @item S
This symbol, if used, must be the very first symbol in the @syntax{PICTURE} value.  A @syntax{S} indicates that the data item is @syntax{Signed}, meaning that negative values are possible for this data item.  Without an @syntax{S}, any negative values stored into this data item via a @syntax{MOVE} or arithmetic statement will have the negative sign stripped from it (in effect becoming the absolute value).
@p The @syntax{S} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p The @syntax{S} symbol may only occur once in a picture string.  @xref{SIGN IS}, for further discussion of how negative values may be stored in a numeric data item.
@p @item V
This symbol is used to define where an implied decimal-point (if any) is located in a numeric item.  Just as there may only be a single decimal point in a number so may there be no more than one @syntax{V} in a @syntax{PICTURE}.  Implied decimal points occupy no space in storage --- they just specify how values are used.  For example, if the value @syntax{1234} is in storage in a field defined as PIC 999V9, that value would be treated as 123.4 in any statements that referenced it.
@p The @syntax{V} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p The @syntax{V} symbol may only occur once in a picture string.
@end table
@item Any editing symbols introduced past this point will, if coded in the picture clause of an otherwise numeric data item, transform that data item from a numeric to a @define{Numeric Edited} data item.  Numeric edited data items are treated as alphanumeric and may not serve either as table subscripts or as source arguments on an arithmetic statement.
@item The following are the fixed insertion editing symbols that may be specified in a picture string.  Each of these editing symbols will insert a special character into the field value at the position it is specified in the picture string.  These editing symbols will each introduce one extra character into the total field size for each occurrence of the symbol in the picture string.
@table @syntax
@p @item B
The @syntax{B} editing symbol introduces a blank into the field value for each occurrence.
@p Multiple @syntax{B} symbols may be coded.
@p The following example will format a ten digit number (presumably a telephone number) into a "@t{### ### ####}" layout:
@verbatim
    ...
        05 Phone-Number       PIC 9(3)B9(3)B9(4).
    ...
        MOVE 5185551212 TO Phone-Number
        DISPLAY Phone-Number
@end verbatim
@* This code will display "@t{518 555 1212}".
@p @item 0
The @syntax{0} (zero) editing symbol introduces one "0" character into the field value for each occurrence in the picture string.
@p Multiple @syntax{0} symbols may be coded.
@p Here's an example:
@verbatim
    ...
        05  Output-Item     PIC 909090909.
    ...
        MOVE 12345 TO Output-Item
        DISPLAY Output-Item
@end verbatim
@* The above will display "@t{102030405}".
@p @item /
The @syntax{/} editing symbol inserts one "/" character into the field value for each occurrence in the picture string.
@p Multiple @syntax{/} symbols may be coded.
@p This editing symbol is most-frequently used to format dates, as follows:
@verbatim
    ...
        05  Year-Month-Day   PIC 9(4)/9(2)/9(2).
    ...
        MOVE 20140207 TO Year-Month-Day
        DISPLAY Year-Month-Day
@end verbatim
@* This example displays "@t{2014/02/07}".
@end table
@item The following are the numeric formatting symbols that may be specified in a picture string.  Each of these editing symbols will insert special characters into the field value to present numbers in a "friendly" format.  These editing symbols will each introduce one extra character into the total field size for each occurrence of the symbol in the picture string.  Numeric fields whose picture clause contains these characters may neither be used as source fields in any calculation nor may they serve as source fields for the transfer of data values to any data item other than an alphanumeric field.
@table @syntax
@p @item .
The @syntax{.} symbol inserts a decimal point into a numeric field value.  When the contents of a numeric data item sending field are moved into a receiving data item whose picture clause contains the @syntax{.} editing symbol, implied (@syntax{V}) or actual decimal point in the sending data item or literal, respectively, will be aligned with the @syntax{.} symbol in the receiving field.  Digits are then transferred from the sending to the receiving field outward from the sending field's "V" or ".", truncating sending digits if there aren't enough positions in the receiving field.  Any digit positions in the receiving field that don't receive digits from the sending field, if any, will be set to 0.
@p The @syntax{.} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p An example will probably help:
@verbatim
    ...
    05  Source-Field   PIC 9(2)V9 VALUE 7.2.
    05  Dest-Field     PIC 9(5).9(2).
    ...
    MOVE 1234567.89 TO Dest-Field
    DISPLAY Dest-Field
    MOVE 19 TO Dest-Field
    DISPLAY Dest-Field
    MOVE Source-Field TO Dest-Field
    DISPLAY Dest-Field
@end verbatim
@* The example will display three results --- "@t{34567.89}", "@t{00019.00}" and "@t{00007.20}".
@p Both data item definitions @i{appear} to have @i{two} decimal points in their picture clauses.  They actually don't, because the last character of every data item definition is always a period --- the period that ends the definition.
@p @item ,
The @syntax{,} symbol serves as a thousands separator.  Many times, you'll see large numbers formatted with these symbols --- for example, 123,456,789.  This can be accomplished easily by adding thousands separator symbols to a picture string.  Thousands separator symbols that aren't needed will behave as if they were @syntax{9}s.
@p The @syntax{,} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p Here's an example:
@verbatim
    ...
    05  My-Lottery-Winnings   PIC 9(3),9(3),9(3).
    ...
    MOVE 12345 TO My-Lottery-Winnings
    DISPLAY My-Lottery-Winnings
@end verbatim
@* The value "@t{0000012,345}" (a very disappointing one for my retirement plans, but a good thousands separator demo) will be displayed.  Notice how, since the first comma wasn't needed due to the meager amount I won, it behaved like another "9".
@end table
@* If desired, you may reverse the roles of the @syntax{.} and @syntax{,} editing symbols by specifying @syntax{DECIMAL POINT IS COMMA} in the @syntaxref{SPECIAL-NAMES} paragraph.
@p @item The following are insertion symbols.  They are used to insert an extra character (two in the case of "CR" and "DB") to signify the sign (positive or negative) of the numeric value that is moved into the field whose picture string contains one of these symbols, or the fact that the data item represents a currency (money) amount.  Only one of the @syntax{+}, @syntax{-}, @syntax{CR} or @syntax{DB} symbols may be used in a picture clause. In this context, when any of these symbols are used in a @term{picture-string}, they must be at the end.  The @syntax{+}, @syntax{-} and/or currency symbols may also be used as floating editing symbols at the @i{beginning} of the @term{picture-string} --- a subject that will be covered in the next numbered paragraph.
@table @syntax
@p @item +
If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), a "+" character will be inserted.  If the value is negative (less than 0), a "-" character is inserted.
@p The @syntax{+} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p @item -
If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), a space will be inserted.  If the value is negative (less than 0), a "-" character is inserted.
@p The @syntax{-} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p @item CR
This symbol is coded as the two characters "C" and "R".  If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), two spaces will be inserted.  If the value is negative (less than 0), the characters "CR" (credit) are inserted.
@p The @syntax{CR} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p @item DB
This symbol is coded as the two characters "D" and "B".  If the value of the numeric value moved into the field is positive (0 or greater), two spaces will be inserted.  If the value is negative (less than 0), the characters "DB" (debit) are inserted.
@p The @syntax{DB} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p @item $
Regardless of the value moved into the field, this symbol will insert the currency symbol into the data item's value in the position where it occurs in the @term{picture-string} (@pxref{SPECIAL-NAMES}).
@p The @syntax{$} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@end table
@item These editing symbols are known as floating replacement symbols.  These symbols may occur in sequences @i{before} any @syntax{9} editing symbols in the @term{picture-string} of a numeric data item.  Using these symbols transforms that numeric data item into a numerid @i{edited} data item, which can no longer be used in calculations or subscripts.
@p @item Each of the following symbols behave like a @syntax{9}, until such point as all digits in the numeric value are exhausted and leading zeros are about to be inserted.  In effect, these editing symbols define what should happen to those leading zero.
@table @syntax
@p @item $
Of those currency symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside, the right-most will have its "0" value replaced by the currency symbol in-effect for the program (@pxref{SPECIAL-NAMES}).  Any remaining leading zero values occupying positions described by this symbol will be replaced by spaces.
@p The @syntax{$} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p Any currency symbol coded to the right of a @syntax{.} will be treated exactly like a @syntax{9}.
@p @item *
This symbol is referred to as a check protection symbol.  All check-protection symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside will have their "0" values replaced by "*".
@p The @syntax{*} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p Any check-suppression symbol coded to the right of a @syntax{.} will be treated exactly like a @syntax{9}.
@p @item +
Of those @syntax{+} symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside, the right-most will have its "0" value replaced by a "+" if the value in the data item is zero or greater or a "-" otherwise.  Any remaining leading zero values occupying positions described by this symbol will be replaced by spaces.  You cannot use both @syntax{+} and @syntax{-} in the same @term{picture-string}.
@p The @syntax{+} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p Any @syntax{+} symbol coded to the right of a @syntax{.} will be treated exactly like a @syntax{9}.
@p @item -
Of those @syntax{-} symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside, the right-most will have its "0" value replaced by a space if the value in the data item is zero or greater or a "-" otherwise.  Any remaining leading zero values occupying positions described by this symbol will be replaced by spaces.  You cannot use both @syntax{+} and @syntax{-} in the same @term{picture-string}.
@p The @syntax{-} symbol is not allowed in conjunction with @syntax{N}.
@p Any @syntax{-} symbol coded to the right of a @syntax{.} will be treated exactly like a @syntax{9}.
@p @item Z
All @syntax{Z} symbols that correspond to character positions in which leading zeros reside will have their "0" values replaced by spaces.
@p Any zero-suppression symbol coded to the right of a @syntax{.} will be treated exactly like a @syntax{9}.
@end table
@p @syntax{Z} and @syntax{*} should not be coded in the same @term{picture-string}
@p @syntax{+} and @syntax{-} should not be coded in the same @term{picture-string}
@p When multiple floating symbols are coded, even if there is only one of them used they will all be considered floating and will all be able to assume each other's properties.  For example, if a data item has a @syntax{PIC +$ZZZZ9.99} @term{picture-string}, and a value of 1 is moved to that field at run-time, the resulting value will be (the @i{b} symbol represents a space) @syntax{@i{bbbb}+$1.00}.  This is not consistent with many other COBOL implementations, where the result would have been @syntax{+$@i{bbbb}1.00}.
@p Most other COBOL implementations reject the use of multiple occurrences of multiple floating editing symbols.  For example, they would reject @term{picture-string}s such as @syntax{+++$$$9.99}, @syntax{$$$ZZZ9.99} and so on.  GNU COBOL accepts these.  Programmers creating GNU COBOL programs should avoid such @term{picture-string}s if there is any liklihood that those programs may be used with other COBOL implementations.

@newsubsection{5.9.43,SUM OF}
@diagram{SUM-OF Clause,DD-SUM-OF-Info,DD-SUM-OF-TeX,None}
@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{REPORT}
@p The @syntax{SUM} clause establishes a summation counter whose value will be arithmetically calculated whenever the field is presented.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{OF} and @syntax{ON} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item The @syntax{SUM} clause may only appear in a @syntax{CONTROL FOOTING} report group.
@p @item If the data item in which the @syntax{SUM} clause appears has been assigned it's own identifier name, and that name is not @syntax{FILLER}, then that data item is referred to as a sum counter.
@p @item All @term{identifier-7} data items must be non-edited numeric in nature.
@p @item If any @term{identifier-7} data item is defined in the report section, it must be a sum counter.
@p @item Any @term{identifier-7} data items that are sum counters must either be defined in the same report group as the data item in which this @syntax{SUM} clause appears or they must be defined in a report data item that exists at a lower level in this report's control hierarchy.  @xref{Control Hierarchy}, for additional information.
@p @item The @syntax{PICTURE} of the report data item in who's description this @syntax{SUM} clause appears in must be such that it would be legal to @syntaxref{MOVE} the specified @term{identifier-7} or @term{literal-2} value to a data item with that @syntax{PICTURE}.
@p @item The following points apply to the @syntaxidx{UPON} option:
@enumerate A
@p @item The data item @term{identifier-9} must be the name of a detail group specified in the same report as the control footing group in which this @syntax{SUM} clause appears.
@p @item The presence of an @syntax{UPON} clause limits the @syntax{SUM} clause to adding the specified numeric literal or identifier value into the sum counter only when a @syntax{GENERATE @term{identifier-9}} statement is executed.
@p @item If there is no @syntax{UPON} clause specified, the value of @term{identifier-7} or @term{literal-2} will be added into the sum counter whenever a @syntaxref{GENERATE} of any detail report group in the report is executed.
@p @item If there is only a single detail group in the report's definition, the @syntax{UPON} clause is meaningless.
@end enumerate
@item The following points apply to the @syntaxidx{RESET} option:
@enumerate A
@p @item If the @syntax{RESET} option is coded, @syntax{FINAL} or @term{identifier-8} (whichever is coded on the @syntax{RESET}) must be one of the report's control breaks specified on the @syntax{CONTROLS} clause.
@p @item If there is no @syntax{RESET} option coded, the sum counter will be reset back to zero after each time the control footing containing the @syntax{SUM} clause is presented.  This is the typical behavior that would be expected.
@p @item If, however, you want to reset the @syntax{SUM} counter only when the control footing for a control break higher in the control hierarchy is presented, specify that higher control break on the @syntax{RESET} option.

@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{FILE}, @strong{WORKING-STORAGE}, @strong{LOCAL-STORAGE}, @strong{LINKAGE}
@p This optional clause optimizes the storage of binary numeric items to store them in such a manner as to make it as fast as possible for the CPU to fetch them.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{SYNCRONIZED} and @syntax{SYNCHRONISED} are interchangeable, and may be abbreviated as @syntax{SYNC}.
@p @item If the @syntax{SYNCRONIZED} clause is coded on anything but a numeric data item with a @syntaxref{USAGE} that specifies storage of data in a binary form, the @syntax{SYNCRONIZED} clause will be ignored.
@p @item Synchronization is performed (by the compiler) as follows:
@enumerate A
@p @item If the binary item occupies one byte of storage, no synchronization is performed.
@p @item If the binary item occupies two bytes of storage, the binary item is allocated at the next half-word boundary.
@p @item If the binary item occupies four bytes of storage, the binary item is allocated at the next word boundary.
@p @item If the binary item occupies four bytes of storage, the binary item is allocated at the next word boundary.
@end enumerate
@end enumerate

The following illustrates the allocation of a group of data items both without and with the @syntax{SYNCRONIZED} option.  The grey blocks represent the unused bytes that are allocated in the Group-Item-2 structure because of the @syntax{SYNC} clauses.

@item Binary data (integer or floating-point) can be stored in either a @i{Big-Endian} or @i{Little-Endian} form.
@p Big-endian data allocation calls for the bytes that comprise a binary item to be allocated such that the least-significant byte is the right-most byte.  For example, a four-byte binary item having a value of decimal 20 would be big-endian allocated as 00000014 (shown in hexadecimal notation).
@p Little-endian data allocation calls for the bytes that comprise a binary item to be allocated such that the least-significant byte is the left-most byte.  For example, a four-byte binary item having a value of decimal 20 would be little-endian allocated as 14000000 (shown in hexadecimal notation).
@p All CPUs are capable of @syntax{understanding} big-endian format, which makes it the @syntax{most-compatible} form of binary storage across computer systems.
@p Some CPUs  such as the Intel/AMD i386/x64 architecture processors used in most Windows PCs  prefer to process binary data stored in a little-endian format.  Since that format is more efficient on those systems, it is referred to as the @syntax{native} binary format.
@p On a system supporting only one format of binary storage (generally, that would be big-endian), the terms 'most-efficient' and 'native format' are synonymous.
@p @item Data items that have the @syntaxidx{UNSIGNED} attribute explicitly coded, or @syntax{DISPLAY}, @syntax{PACKED-DECIMAL}, @syntax{COMP-5}, @syntax{COMP-X} items that do not have an @syntax{S} symbol in their picture clause cannot preserve negative values that may be stored into them.  Storing a negative value into such a field will actually result in the sign being stripped, essentially saving the absolute value in the data item.
@p @item Packed-decimal (i.e. @syntax{USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL}, @syntax{USAGE COMP-3} or @syntax{USAGE COMP-6}) data is stored as a series of bytes such that each byte contains two 4-bit fields, referred to as 'nibbles' (since they comprise half a "byte", they're just "nibbles" --- don't groan, I don't just make this stuff up!).  Each nibble represents a @syntax{9} in the @syntax{PICTURE} and each holds a single decimal digit encoded as its binary value (0 = 0000, 1 = 0001, @dots{} , 9 = 1001).
@p The @i{last} byte of a @syntax{PACKED-DECIMAL} or @syntax{COMP-3} data item will always have its left nibble corresponding to the last @syntax{9} in the @syntax{PICTURE} and its right nibble reserved as a sign indicator.  This sign indicator is always present regardless of whether or not the @syntax{PICTURE} included an @syntax{S} symbol.
@p The @i{first} byte of the data item will contain an unused left nibble if the @syntax{PICTURE} had an even number of @syntax{9} symbols in it.
@p The sign indicator will have a value of a hexadecimal A thru F.  Traditional packed decimal encoding rules call for hecadecimal values of F, A, C or E ("FACE") in the sign nibble to indicate a positive value and B or D to represent a negative value (hexadecimal digits 0-9 are undefined).  Testing with a Windows MinGW/GNU COBOL implementation shows that -- in fact -- hex digit D represents a negative number and any other hexadecimal digit denotes a positive number.  Therefore, a @syntax{PIC S9(3) COMP-3} packed-decimal field with a value of -15 would be stored internally as a hexadecimal 015D in GNU COBOL.
@p If you attempt to store a negative number into a packed decimal field that has no @syntax{S} in its @syntax{PICTURE}, the absolute value of the negative number will actually be stored.
@p @syntax{USAGE COMP-6} does not allow for negative values, therefore no sign nibble will be allocated.  A @syntax{USAGE COMP-6} data item containing an odd number of @syntax{9} symbols in its @syntax{PICTURE} will leave its leftmost nibble unused.
@p @item The @syntax{USAGE} specifications @syntax{FLOAT-DECIMAL-16} and @syntax{FLOAT-DECIMAL-34} will encode data using IEEE 754 @syntax{Decimal64} and @syntax{Decimal128} format, respectively.  The former allows for up to 16 digits of exact precision while the latter offers 34.  The phrase "exact precision" is used because the traditional binary renderings of decimal real numbers in a floating-point format (@syntax{FLOAT-LONG} and @syntax{FLOAT-SHORT}, for example) only yield an approximation of the actual value because many decimal fractions cannot be precisely rendered in binary.  The Decimal64 and Decimal128 renderings, however, render decimal real numbers in encoded decimal form in much the same way that @syntax{PACKED-DECIMAL} renders a decimal integer in digit-by-digit decimal form.  The exact manner in which this rendering is performed is complex (Wikipedia has an excellent article on the subject  just search for @syntax{Decimal64}).
@p @item GNU COBOL stores @syntax{FLOAT-DECIMAL-16} and @syntax{FLOAT-DECIMAL-34} data items using either Big-Endian or Little-Endian form, whichever is native to the system.
@p @item The @syntax{USAGE} specifications @syntax{FLOAT-LONG} and @syntax{FLOAT-SHORT} use the IEEE 754 @syntax{Binary64} and @syntax{Binary32} formats, respectively.  These are binary encodings of real decimal numbers, and as such cannot represent every possible value between the minimum and maximum values in the range for those usages.  Wikipedia has an excellent article on the Binary64 and Binary32 encoding schemes  just search on @syntax{Binary32} or @syntax{Binary64}.
@p GNU COBOL stores @syntax{FLOAT-LONG} and @syntax{FLOAT-SHORT} data items using either Big-Endian or Little-Endian form, whichever is native to the system.
@p @item A @syntax{USAGE} clause specified at the group item level will apply that @syntax{USAGE} to all subordinate data items, except those that themselves have a @syntax{USAGE} clause.
@p @item The only @syntax{USAGE} that is allowed in the report section is @syntax{USAGE DISPLAY}.

@center This syntax is valid in the following sections:
@center @strong{FILE}, @strong{WORKING-STORAGE}, @strong{LOCAL-STORAGE}, @strong{LINKAGE}, @strong{REPORT}, @strong{SCREEN}
@p The @syntax{VALUE} clause is used to define condition names or to assign values (at compilation time) to data items.
@enumerate
@p @item The reserved words @syntax{ARE} and @syntax{IS} are optional and may be included, or not, at the discretion of the programmer.  The presence or absence of these words has no effect upon the program.
@p @item This clause cannot be specified on the same data item as a @syntaxref{FROM}, @syntaxref{TO} or @syntaxref{USING} clause.
@p @item The following points apply to using the @syntax{VALUE} clause in the definition of a condition name:

@end enumerate
@item  The following points apply to using the @syntax{VALUE} clause in the definition of any other data item:
@enumerate A
@p @item In this context, @syntax{VALUE} specifies an initial compilation-time value that will be assigned to the storage occupied by the data item in the program object code generated by the compiler.
@p @item The @syntax{VALUE} clause is ignored on @syntaxref{EXTERNAL} data items or on any data items defines as subordinate to an @syntax{EXTERNAL} data item.
@p @item This format of the @syntax{VALUE} clause may not be used anywhere in the description of an 01 item (or any of it's subordinate items) serving as an @syntax{FD} or @syntax{SD} record description.
@p @item If the optional @syntaxidx{ALL} clause is used, it may only be used with an alphanumeric literal value; the value will be repeated as needed to completely fill the data item.  Here are some examples with and without @syntax{ALL} (the symbol @i{b} denotes a space):
@p @example
PIC X(5) VALUE "A"      *> A@i{bbbb}
PIC X(5) VALUE ALL "A"  *> AAAAA
PIC 9(3) VALUE 1        *> 001
PIC 9(3) VALUE ALL "1"  *> 111
@end example
@item When used in the definition of a screen data item:
@enumerate a
@p @item A figurative constant may not be supplied as @term{literal-1}.
@p @item Any @syntaxref{FROM}, @syntaxref{TO} or @syntaxref{USING} clause in the same data item's definition will be ignored.
@p @item If there is no picture clause specified, the size of the screen data item will be the length of the @term{literal-1} value.
@p @item If there is no picture clause and the @syntax{ALL} option is specified, the @syntax{ALL} option will be ignored.
@end enumerate
@item Giving a table an initial, compile-time value is one of the trickier aspects of COBOL data definition.  There are basically three standard techniques and a fourth that people familiar with other COBOL implementations but new to GNU COBOL may find interesting.  So, here are the three @i{standard} approaches:
@enumerate a
@p @item Don't bother worrying about it at compile-time.  Use the @syntaxref{INITIALIZE} to initialize all data item occurrences in a table (at run-time) to their data-type-specific default values (numerics: 0, alphabetic and alphanumerics: spaces).
@p @item Initialize small tables at compile time by including a @syntax{VALUE} clause on the group item that serves as a parent to the table, as follows:
@p @example
05  SHIRT-SIZES          VALUE "S 14M 15L 16XL17".
    10 SHIRT-SIZE-TBL    OCCURS 4 TIMES.
       15 SST-SIZE       PIC X(2).
       15 SST-NECK       PIC 9(2).
@end example
@item Initialize tables of almost any size at compilation time by utilizing the @syntaxref{REDEFINES} clause:
@p @example
05  SHIRT-SIZE-VALUES.
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE "S 14".
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE "M 15".
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE "L 16".
    10 PIC X(4)          VALUE @syntax{XL17}.
05  SHIRT-SIZES          REDEFINES SHIRT-SIZE-VALUES.
    10 SHIRT-SIZE-TBL    OCCURS 4 TIMES.
       15 SST-SIZE       PIC X(2).
       15 SST-NECK       PIC 9(2).
@end example
@* Admittedly, this table is much more verbose than the one shown with a group @syntax{VALUE}.  What is good about this initialization technique, however, is that you can have as many @syntax{FILLER} and @syntax{VALUE} items as you need for a larger table, and those values can be as long as necessary!
@end enumerate
@item Many COBOL compilers do not allow the use of @syntax{VALUE} and @syntaxref{OCCURS} on the same data item; additionally, they don't allow a @syntax{VALUE} clause on a data item subordinate to an @syntax{OCCURS}.  GNU COBOL, however, has neither of these restrictions!
@p Observe the following example, which illustrates a fourth manner in which tables may be initialized in GNU COBOL:
@p @example
05  X           OCCURS 6 TIMES.
    10 A        PIC X(1) VALUE '?'.
    10 B        PIC X(1) VALUE '%'.
    10 N        PIC 9(2) VALUE 10.
@end example
@* In this example, all six @syntax{A} items will be initialized to "?", all six @syntax{B} items will be initialized to "%" and all six @syntax{N} items will be initialized to 10.  It's not clear exactly how many times this sort of initialization will be useful, but it's there if you need it.
@end enumerate
@item The @syntaxref{FROM}, @syntaxref{TO}, @syntaxref{USING} and @syntax{VALUE} clauses are mutually-exclusive in any screen section data itsm's definition.
